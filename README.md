# ASTRA
ASTRA is a Python voice assistant that uses SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, gTTS, pywhatkit, Wikipedia API, OpenCV, feedparser, and requests to perform tasks via voice commands. It can play YouTube videos, fetch news, tell jokes, open the camera, and provide real-time information like time and IP address.
